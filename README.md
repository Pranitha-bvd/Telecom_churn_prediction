# DP-Project

We are group 6. This project was performed as a requirement of the course Data Programming.

The title is "TELECOM CHURN ANALYSIS". Here's the link - https://github.com/kamrul28890/DP-Project/blob/main/DP_Project_Final.ipynb

PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Telecommunication companies often face problem with customer churn, which is the loss of customers who stop using their services. To solve this problem, companies need to identify the customers who are likely to unsubscribe their services and take pre-emptive measures to retain them. With the help of various Machine learning models, we can predict the customers who are most likely to churn, based on various factors such as customer usage patterns, payment history, and demographics.

PRIMARY PURPOSE:
The fundamental goal of these predictive models is to anticipate whether a telecommunications customer will cancel their subscription or not. These models provide a probability or binary classification label for each customer, indicating the probability of churn. This forecast can be quite useful for recognizing customers who may be considering leaving and implementing proactive strategies to keep them engaged.
